## Why?
The main reason I decided to build this is because I need a simple tool to create good looking invoices/estimates/receipts but couldn't find a product that suits my needs. I don't do invoicing for a living but I do need it occasionally so an ideal invoicing app to be would just need to be good at one thing and one thing only, which is making invoices.

I believe there are many people such as freelance designers, developers, photographers or writers... also have such need. Sadly, I did my research and most (if not all) products that I found have these these problems:

**Complexity**

* Most invoicing products nowadays is web-based, which means you’ll need to maintain a new account (possible a monthly fee, too) just to create an invoice.
* Sure, there some open-source products that can be self-hosted, but that will introduce a new layer of complexity to your workflow. Who will setup the product? Who will maintain the server? Who will cover the cost? ...
* You will always need internet connection to be able to create your invoices. It can be slow sometimes.

**Privacy**

* When you use a web service, most of the time, you’re giving away your data whether you want it or not. Financial data is sensitive and I believe that no one should know about your data except yourself.

## Goals
With that in mind, I know that Manta would need to satisfy these criteria:

* 🚀 Fast!!!
* 👍 Friendly UI & UX
* 🎉 Has nice looking templates
* 🔒 Does not touch user’s data
* 💰 Free! :)

This is still in beta and it's far from perfect but I hope it did meet those requirements.
