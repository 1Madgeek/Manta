## Why?
The main reason I decided to build this is because I need a simple tool to create a good looking invoices/estimates/receipts but couldn't find a product that suits my needs. I did my research and most (if not all) products that I found have these these problem:

**Complexity**

* Most invoicing tool products nowadays is web-based, which means you’ll need to maintain a new account (possible a monthly fee, too).
* You will always need internet connection to be able to create your invoices. It can be slow sometimes.

**Privacy**

* When you use a web service, most of the time, you’re giving your data whether you want to share it or not. Financial data is sensitive and I believe that no one should know about your data except yourself.
* Sure, there some open-source products that can be self-hosted, but that will introduce a new layer of complexity to your workflow. Who will setup the product? who will maintain the server …?

## Goals
So, my ideal app would need to satisfy these criteria:

* Fast
* Friendly UI & UX
* Has nice looking templates
* Des not touch user’s data
* Free! :)

I hope you’ll find this product DOES meet its requirements. :)
